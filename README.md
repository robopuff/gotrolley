# Go TrolleyGame

## Run

```bash
$ go run *.go
```

## What happend to the GUI?
It chickened out.

## Credits

Basic idea comes from [krazov/trolley-game-vue](https://github.com/krazov/trolley-game) which is
a rewrite of [InALunch/TrolleyGame](https://github.com/InALunch/TrolleyGame).

That being said this a rewrite of [InALunch/TrolleyGame](https://github.com/InALunch/TrolleyGame) in Go.

Made for fun with no apparent reason.
